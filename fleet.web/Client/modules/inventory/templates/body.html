        <h2>What's interesting about this?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>RequireJs is used to load the entire application.</li>
            <li>The header, this body, and footer sections are all defined in a Marionette module, called 'inventory'.</li>
            <li>The inventory module definition utilizes multiple files, which are all loaded by RequireJS.</li>
            <li>The templates are in separate files as well, and are loaded asynchronously once the inventory module is ready.</li>
            <li>When built for production ("Release" configuration), the module and it's templates are all stored in a single file.</li>
        </ul>
