        <h2>What's interesting about this, so far?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>RequireJs is used to load the entire application.</li>
            <li>The header, this body, and footer sections are all defined in two Marionette modules, called 'main' and 'inventory'.</li>
            <li>The module definitions span multiple files, which are all loaded by RequireJS.</li>
            <li>The templates are in separate files as well, and are loaded asynchronously once the inventory module is ready.</li>
            <li>The inventory module is loaded on-demand, reducing initial load time.</li>
        </ul>
